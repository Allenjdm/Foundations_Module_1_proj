# Lambda Foundations

## Intro to Technology at Lambda

### Module 1 Project

Congratulations! You have made it this far. This is a website called "Github". It is a very important tool for the modern web developer. We will learn more about it in the future, for now you don't need to concern yourself with what it is or how it works. We are using this website as a cloud hosting service. Please follow the next steps to get to Part 2 of the project!

### Step One: Download .zip file.

In this first step you will download a .zip file from this website. To do this, follow these instructions:

1. Click on the Green button that says `Code` in the upper right hand side of the screen.
2. You will see an option at the bottom called `Download Zip`
3. You will need to find the place the .zip file downloded to. This will usually be the `Downloads` folder on your computer. Tip: if you are using Chrome, you should be able to click on the download itself in the bottom left hand corner of your browse, this will open the location of the downloaded file in `My Computer` or `Finder`

### Step Two: Unzip the file.

In the past we needed special software to "unzip" a file. For most modern computers all it takes is double clicking on the .zip file itself. Once you unzip the file you should see a `Folder` or `Directory` with the name "Foundations_Module_1_proj" next to the .zip file.

### Step Three: Open the .txt file in VS Code.

Now that you have the file unzipped, Open the file `project.txt` in VS Code (or your text editor of choice). There are a number of different ways to do this:

1. Drag the file `project.txt` to the VS Code icon on your desktop and drop it.
2. Open VS Code, then click on File > Open. You will then need to find the location of `project.txt` and double click it.

### Step Four: Complete the excersizes in project.tex

Once you have `project.txt` open you can complete the excersizes for Part 2!
