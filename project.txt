Hello and welcome to the first module project of Lambda Foundations course!

You made it to the second part! Now that we've explored some of the tools we use at Lambda, will be doing a little bit of self 
exploration and exploring your computer. The following questions are meant to be answered by you in your text editor. You will 
then save this file and upload it to Canvas.

In this next section we would like you to do a little digging of your own. One of the most important skills in software developement
is being able to track down the answer to a problem, or to learn something autonomously. Find the answers to these questions and answer 
them here (don't worry, this is just an excersize, there are no right or wrong answers here).
